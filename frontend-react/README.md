- `src/pages/` : React page components (Login, Dashboard, User/Admin dashboards, Add Store, User Registration)
- `App.js` & `App.css` : Main React app file and styling.

Install Dependencies

Navigate to the frontend folder in your terminal.

Run the following command to install all required packages:

    npx create-react-app frontend-react
        cd frontend-react
          npm start

This will open your React application in your default browser, typically at localhost:3000.



After installation, start the frontend server:

npm start


The app will launch in your default browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.


Make sure the backend server is running and connected to the database.

The frontend will automatically communicate with the backend APIs.
